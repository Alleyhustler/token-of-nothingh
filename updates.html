                  <p>Hello! It's been a while. Work, life, etc. as always. I am 30 now, which is incredible. Also incredible is that during my absence I've reached 100 followers on my Neocities profile. Thank you so much!</p>
                  <p>Some updates</p>

                    <li>New version of <a href="templates/cc-link/index.html">CC-LINK</a> is out. I've fixed a weird bug that made my website and other people's website's sidebar menu look wonky. No more wonkiness!</li>
                    <li>Changed some colours and fonts on my website here and there, reshuffled some stuff from my About page.</li>
                    <li>Trying to get into gear to update this website more regularly again but it's now basically summer in Australia and on hot and sunny days when I'm not working I'd rather be outside than on my computer lol... I'll be back though.</li>

                <p>Little update post! I've been meaning to add these a month ago then a bunch of things happened and I was AFK for a bit.</p>
                <p>I'm excited to make new pages for this website, I feel like my motivation is coming back to me which is nice. I've always been bad at maintaining things long term so it's nice that despite being less frequent than last year, I can still update this website and not feel bad about my own sporadicness.</p>
                <ul class="arrow-list">
                  <li>I updated my old Dunkin Donuts rip-off logo button! The old one was wonky and a bit boring and I kinda hated it lol. Now I like both of my buttons! If you have me linked on your website with that button, please update it!</li>
                  <li>Added a button featuring the Aboriginal flag on my index page!</li>
                  <li>Made two versions of the button available on <a href="buttons.html">my buttons page</a>. Feel free to use these, especially if you live in so-called Australia like me. :)</li>

                <h3>05.12.2023</h3>
                <p>Hello! It's been a while. Still busy with regular end-of-year quarter stuff which means I'll probably be mostly AFK with site updates until the new year.</p>
                <p>I really do want to write my manifesto and start really working on that fanfic/story website template I've been idly working on earlier this year so I think those are going to be my priorities when I get back to this. :)</p>
                <ul class="arrow-list">
                  <li>Added a button on my homepage as a small token of visible support for the Palestinian people, their resilience against genocide, and their unconditional right to peace and self-determination. I got the button from <a href="https://hillhouse.neocities.org/journal/notes/palestine">hillhouse (and there's more buttons and resources on her page, please take a look!)</a></li>
                  <li>On that note, please if you can, show up to actions IRL whether it's protests and marches, or other forms of direct action like blockades or calling your representatives to call for a <i>full</i> ceasefire. It's frustrating how many cowards we have in government all across the western world, but pressure works. Solidarity works.</li>
                  <li>Stay safe, and happy December!</li>

                <h3>16.10.2023</h3>
                <p>First update in a month! I've considerably slowed down with progress on this website because I'm really busy with regular life stuff, but here are some updates.</p>
                <ul class="arrow-list">
                  <li>It was my birthday last week, and I totally forgot to update my age everywhere... I'm 29 now.</li>
                  <li>I've made a <a href="https://debtdeath.thoughts.page/">thoughts.page account</a>!</li>
                  <li>Links no longer open in a new tab by default. This is for accessibility reasons, it turns out my "I always open links in a new tab so surely everyone else does" instinct was wrong, and you should be giving people a choice on whether they actually want to open links in a new tab! You can read more about this on this little article from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/">css-tricks.com</a>.</li>
                  <li>Cosmetic fixes here and there.</li>

                <h3>14.09.2023</h3>
                <p>Big update!</p>
                <ul class="arrow-list">
                  <li><a href="friends.html" >Friends page is live!</a> It's still a work in progress but it works as is, will be adding more soon.</li>
                  <li>Made a bunch of custom buttons, so <a href="buttons.html" >I made them available as free resources!</a></li>
                  <li>Re-organised the homepage: bumped the 18+ content warning up, added a button wall at the bottom.</li>
                  <li>Joined the <a href="https://pinkvampyr.leprd.space/accessiblenet/" >Accessible Net directory</a> and the <a href="https://bisexualism.emeowly.gay/" >Bisexualism webring!</a></li>

                <p>A series of quick-fixes while I work on my friends page...</p>
                <ul class="arrow-list">
                  <li>Redid the little arrow after my section links. I previously used a glyph which turned out to be a bit confusing when I did a test with a screen reader. It's visually very similar to the old one now but should be screen reader-friendly.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a typo, I hope no one noticed where it was.</li>
                  <li>Re-organised my <a href="webmastery.html" >Webmastery</a> page. Added a few things to it too.</li>
                  <li>Added stuff to my <a href="#big-todo-list">big ol' to-do list</a>.</li>

                <ul class="arrow-list">
                  <li>Made a new website button! I think this is my best one yet. Check it out on my sidebar!</li>
                  <li>I'm working on my friends page... I'm trying to figure out how I want to display all this Information and I also need to get consent from my non-website-having friends to link to their social media profiles etc so this one may take a few days.</li>

                <p>It's September! I'm now getting a little busier with work so I'm not going to be updating this site every few days like I did before but that's OK! I'm still making little changes whenever I have the time.</p>
                <p>Speaking of changes...</p>
                <ul class="arrow-list">
                  <li>Added a link to my Neocities profile in the footer.</li>

                <ul class="arrow-list">
                  <li>Significant redesign of the website under the hood. Visually I think pretty much only the header font looks different (and easier to deal with than an expanded font that loves to overflow on mobile view lol), but I changed a bunch of stuff in the code for more coherence... Mostly for my eyes only.</li>
                  <li>Haven't had the time lately to tackle the rest of my to-do list but up next is the friends page!</li>
                  <li>Could make a general outlinks page but it all depends on how much I end up having on my hands... we'll see.</li>
